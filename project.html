<!--All this page was created directly in HTML by the members of the team. No one of us knew how to handle HTML so we learnt and we're learning step by step. We belive that, as well as the other part of the project, all what we're going to present has to be done by us. We're sorry if the website will be at first a bit ugly but we promise we'll improve it. Thank you for your time, The Tiger Team: Elisabetta, Giacomo and Francesco.-->
