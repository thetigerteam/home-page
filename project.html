All this page was created directly in HTML by the members of the team. No one of us knew how to handle HTML so we learnt and we're learning step by step. We belive that, as well as the other part of the project, all what we're going to present has to be done by us. Thank you for your time, The Tiger Team: Elisabetta, Giacomo and Francesco.-->

<h2>Intentions of the project</h2>

     <p>Our project has the aim of creating the space station which will substitute the ISS once its mission will be at an end. We have considered some key elements that are going to be protagonist in the long-term space exploration and we have applied them to the new space station so they’ll be tested. In this way the new international space station is going to be the outpost of humankind like its predecessor.</p>
