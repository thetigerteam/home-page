All this page was created directly in HTML by the members of the team. No one of us knew how to handle HTML so we learnt and we're learning step by step. We belive that, as well as the other part of the project, all what we're going to present has to be done by us. Thank you for your time, The Tiger Team: Elisabetta, Giacomo and Francesco.-->

<p class="test1">We are three students of Licei Valdagno and we take scientific classes in the fourth year. We have different passions: maths, physics, english, astronomy and tecnology. Mixed all together they build space exploration. We build <em>The Tiger Team</em>! The name of our team takes inspiration from the Tiger Team created during Apollo 13 to fix several problems of the spacecraft. We, as well, in our project fix several problems that might affect the next International Space Station. Step by step, from september 2016 to march 2017 with weekly afternoon meetings, we analysed everything and we found solutions explained in <a href="project.html">our work</a>.</p>
